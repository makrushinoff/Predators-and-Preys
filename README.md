# Predators and Preys

## Project for OOP course

Predators and Preys - is e step-by-step emulator of evolution of animal population, that present by predators and preys.

On each step of simulation, preys and predators move on the map, looking for food. Separate cells on map are food for preys, which are food for predators.
When predators appear on the prey cell - predators eat this prey. The same for preys and dood (grass for example).
Every simulation step decrease animals` health points by one. 
There are 3 types of predators and 3 types of preys. They differ from each other by 
  1) number of their own steps on map, during one step in simulation.
  2) Health points.
  3) Number of food, that need for reproduction.

Application based on Java Core, all OOP aspects, features and principles and GoF patterns.
Visual part based on GUI, by JavaFX.
